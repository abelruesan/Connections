# Connections
Python program simulating the New York Times Connections game

You can choose the number of words in each level and the number of attempts.

There are two files. The file palabras.py contains 4 lists (each of one level) containing the words of that level grouped by topic.

The main.py file is the one containing the program. 

The program works very similar to the original Connectiones game. You can select and deselect the words, shuffle the words...

I hope you like my program,

Abel Rueda
